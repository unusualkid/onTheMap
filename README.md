On The Map
On The Map is an app that allows user to see other Udacity's students checkins on a map. The map will contain pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will also be able to add and edit their own checkin by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.

### To run:
1. Open Xcode.
2. Connect to an iOS device.
3. Click the run button or `COMMAND + R` to open on device.
